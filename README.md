# Note

I am very sorry that I have planned not continue to maintain this project. 

According to the issue [#13 collaborating on golsp](https://github.com/saibing/bingo/issues/13), I hope that we will eventually have a unified language server: 
gopls that Google's upcoming Go language server. 

It is in the best interests of the community to only have a single language server. 

I have ported some features such as references, rename, workspace symbol, implementation of [bingo](https://github.com/saibing/bingo)  to gopls.

If you want to use the enhanced version of gopls, try [https://github.com/saibing/tools](https://github.com/saibing/tools).
